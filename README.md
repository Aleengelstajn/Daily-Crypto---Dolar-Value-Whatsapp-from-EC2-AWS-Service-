# Daily-Crypto---Dolar-Value-Whatsapp-from-EC2-AWS-Service-

In this project, 2 different APIs are consulted to later have some information of interest.
Then a function is set up to send said information to my whatsapp.
An AWS EC2 instance on Ubuntu is then configured to schedule that script to run periodically in the cloud with crontab.
